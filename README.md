# GLDNF WARRIOR LOADER

<img src="https://github.com/DesignisOrion/GLDNF-Warrior-Loader/blob/main/img/one.png" alt="GLDNF Character" />

An app that allows users to choose their GLDNF Warrior using the GUI. The GUI was created using PySimpleGUI. I wanted to learn a new GUI library and came across PySimpleGUI. The goal here was to create a file browser that would load different image formats. Attached are 2 warriors (.png) in which I created using Asesprite pixel art software. I also included the .exe file which can be found under "dist" folder. Enjoy!

## Usage
```python packages
pip install pysimplegui
pip install pillow
```

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg
import os
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
import io
```
